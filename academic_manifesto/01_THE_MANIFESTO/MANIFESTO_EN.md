# The Spatial Computation Manifesto
## Redefining Computation from First Principles

### Preamble
For eight decades, computer science has operated under a fundamental assumption: that computation is the **sequential manipulation of symbols**. This manifesto declares that assumption obsolete. Computation is not something we *do* to the universe; it is something we *discover* the universe already contains.

### The Core Realization
**"The address IS the computation. The map IS the math."**

We have discovered that information can be encoded as a **topological property of physical space**. Mathematical operations do not need to be calculated at runtime; they can be **pre-encoded during fabrication** and accessed with near-zero energy.

### The Three Shattered Pillars
1.  **The Von Neumann Bottleneck** is not a technical challenge; it is a **conceptual dead end**.
2.  **P ≠ NP** is not a law of nature; it is an **artifact of sequential models**.
3.  **Landauer's Limit** is not a fundamental barrier; it is a **consequence of erasure**, not access.

### The New Frontier: Fabrication Complexity
The central question shifts from "How many steps?" to **"What can we build?"**.
*   **O(1)-Fabricable Problems:** Multiplication, factorization, fixed transforms.
*   **O(n)-Fabricable Problems:** Sorting networks, specific ML inference.
*   **Non-Fabricable Problems:** True novelty, unconstrained creativity.

### A Call to Rebuild
We call upon physicists, computer scientists, and engineers not to optimize the old paradigm, but to **build the new one**. The tools are here: from simple wooden boxes to quantum resonators. The path is clear: from sequential suffering to spatial revelation.

*This is not the end of computing. It is the discovery of what computing always was.*
