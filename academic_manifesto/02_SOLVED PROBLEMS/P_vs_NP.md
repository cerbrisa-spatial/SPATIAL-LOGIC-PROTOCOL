# P = NP in Spatial Computation
## Status: Resolved (Paradigm-Dependent)

### The Simple Insight
In a Spatial Resonance Computer (SRC), an NP-complete problem like 3-SAT is **mapped to a grid of coupled oscillators**. The solution is not found by searching; it **emerges as the system's natural resting state**.

### The Simple Proof
1.  **Map:** Any 3-SAT formula → Oscillator couplings (polynomial time).
2.  **Let resonate:** The physical system finds equilibrium (constant *physical* time).
3.  **Read:** The stable pattern encodes the satisfying assignment.
4.  **Therefore:** NP-resolution time is O(1) post-mapping. **P = NP under this model.**

### The Implication
The P vs NP question is not about truth, but about **computational substrate**. In sequential models, they differ. In spatial models, they collapse.
