Copyright (c) 2025 Wilbert Contreras Borda. All rights reserved.

1. DEFINITIONS
* "The Protocol": Refers to the principles, methods, algorithms, and designs known as Contreras Borda Spatial Logic, including but not limited to: the resonance level concept (x1, x40, x1600), the Z-Axis Operator, L# Sector Logic, pattern resonance, the Thermal Cylinder hardware design, and the Spatial Abacus methodology.
* "Methods": Synonymous with "The Protocol".
* "Commercial Use": Any use aimed at or resulting in revenue, commercial benefit, competitive advantage, or cost savings for a private or government entity. This includes implementation in products, services, internal infrastructure (e.g., corporate data centers), or privately funded R&D.
* "Derived Intellectual Property": Any invention, improvement, new method, software, hardware design, academic publication, or other intellectual property asset conceived, reduced to practice, or developed as a direct result of using, studying, or experimenting with "The Protocol".
* "Researcher": Any individual or entity using "The Protocol" under this license.

2. RESEARCH LICENSE GRANT
Permission is granted, free of charge, to any person or educational institution, to use "The Protocol" solely for:
* Personal, non-commercial research and academic study.
* Demonstrations for exclusively educational purposes (including modeling in environments like Minecraft).
* Non-commercial scientific experimentation.
This grant DOES NOT INCLUDE the right to publish derivative works incorporating "The Protocol" without separate, written permission from the Licensor (Wilbert Contreras Borda), as detailed in Section 4.

3. COMMERCIAL RESTRICTIONS & PATENT STATUS
"The Protocol" is PATENT-PENDING.
* Any form of "Commercial Use" is strictly prohibited without a prior, written commercial license agreement signed by Wilbert Contreras Borda.

In permitted publications, this attribution must be in a clearly visible location (e.g., the acknowledgments section of a paper or the credits page of software).

6. REVERSION OF RIGHTS FOR MATHEMATICAL PRIZES
In the specific case that the application of "The Protocol" leads directly to the complete and recognized solution of a prized mathematical problem (e.g., the Clay Mathematics Institute's Millennium Prize Problems), all monetary awards, primary intellectual recognition, and associated publication rights shall belong entirely to Wilbert Contreras Borda, unless a prior, written collaboration agreement stipulates different terms.

7. BREACH AND LEGAL ACTION
Violation of any term of this license, including unauthorized "Commercial Use" or unauthorized publication of derivatives, will result in the immediate and automatic revocation of all rights granted herein.
