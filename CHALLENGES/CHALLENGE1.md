​🔍 The Wilbert Contreras Challenge: Decoding Spatial Resonance
​The Hypothesis: Every significant ancient or modern structure is a physical manifestation of a logic grid. Its "efficiency" is not in its beauty, but in its Spatial Resonance.
​🛠 The Mission
​Choose a building (The Parthenon, The Great Pyramid, or even a local Cathedral) and calculate its resonance using the Contreras Borda Protocol:
​Identify the Grid #: What is the base unit of the floor plan? How does it align with the cardinal or celestial axes?
​Measure the Z-Shift: Locate the three levels of height. Does the structure expand or contract as it rises? (x1 \to x40 \to x1600).
​Detect the Thermal Flow: Where would the "heat" (energy/people/air) move? Does it follow a cylindrical or spiral path?
​📤 How to Submit
​Post your findings in the Issues tab of this repository or upload a diagram to the /community_research folder.
​"Don't just look at the stone. Calculate the resonance. The rest will reveal itself later."
