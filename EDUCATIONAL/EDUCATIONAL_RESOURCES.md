# 🎓 Spatial Education & Re-education
## Teaching the Type 1 Civilization Logic

To change the world, we must change how we perceive space. This file contains the foundations for educating children and re-training adults in the **B&W Contreras Borda** logic.

### 1. The "Three-Leaf" Exercise (For Kids)
**Objective:** Visualize the Z-Axis Level Shift.
* **Materials:** 3 transparent sheets (or thin paper).
* **Step 1:** On Sheet 1 ($x1$), draw a single dot (The Fact).
* **Step 2:** On Sheet 2 ($x40$), draw a square around where the dot would be (The Context).
* **Step 3:** On Sheet 3 ($x1600$), draw a cube that contains the square (The Universal Logic).
* **Lesson:** Everything that seems small has a massive volume of meaning above it.

### 2. The Ontological Daily Map (For Adults)
**Objective:** Stop linear thinking (Lists) and start Spatial thinking (Volumes).
* **Exercise:** Instead of a "To-Do List", draw a **Cylinder**. 
* Place urgent tasks at the base ($L1$).
* Place relationship/family tasks in the middle ($L2$).
* Place your legacy/vision tasks at the top ($L3$).
* **Lesson:** If the top of the cylinder is empty, you are burning energy without purpose.

### 3. Printables & DIY
