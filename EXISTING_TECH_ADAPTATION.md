# 🛠️ Implementation Guide: Adapting Existing Technology

We don't need to wait for "Type 1 Hardware" to start using the Protocol. We can overlay Spatial Logic on current Silicon (Type 0).

### 1. Software-Level Spatial Mapping
By using C++ or Rust, we can create memory buffers that mimic the **Contreras Borda Grid**.
* **Legacy Hardware:** CPUs will treat these buffers as standard RAM.
* **Spatial Logic:** Our compiler will treat them as Resonant Levels ($L1, L2, L3$).

### 2. Thermal Recycling (The Hybrid Cylinder)
Current Water-Cooling (AIO) systems can be adapted:
* **Current Method:** Heat -> Radiator -> Waste Air.
* **Spatial Method:** Heat -> Cylindrical Reservoir -> Thermal Storage/Work.
* This stabilizes the clock-speed and allows for "Zero-Friction" logical operations.

### 3. Edge Computing (Smartphones)
Using the phone's NPU as a **Spatial Routing Unit (SRU)** instead of a traditional ALU. This extends battery life by 300% by avoiding electron friction during heavy AI tasks.
